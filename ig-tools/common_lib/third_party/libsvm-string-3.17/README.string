LIBSVM data format is as follows,

<label> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> <index3>:<value3>...(instance#1)
<label> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> <index3>:<value3>...(instance#2)
................................................................(etc.)

The above values <value#> must be real numbers. Now, we extend those
attribute values into string data type. The data format is shown
below:

<class-label> <string-value> (instance#1)
<class-label> <string-value> (instance#2)
<class-label> <string-value> (instance#3)
............................ (etc.)

An example is

1 abcca
1 abcac
2 bcadc

Two sample data sets are included in this package: word.data
and bit.data.

The usage is the same libsvm, but you must specify `-t 5' to use a string kernel:

> svm-train -t 5 ...

Currently we implement 

exp(-gamma * edit(x,y)^2)

where edit(x,y) is the edit distance between two strings. This
function may not always produce a PSD kernel matrix, but practically
it seems to work well. You can easily modify svm.cpp to implement
other string kernels.

This code is extended from standard libsvm. Our experience on string
data is still limited, so your comments are very welcome.  Please
